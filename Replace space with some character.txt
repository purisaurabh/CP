You have been given a string 'STR' of words. You need to replace all the spaces between words with “@40”.
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases. 

The first line of each test case will contain a single string 'STR' consisting of one or more words. 
Output Format:
For each test case, return the modified string after replacing all the spaces between words with “@40”.

Print the output of each test case in a separate line.
Note:
You don’t need to print anything, It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
0 <= |STR| <= 100

Where ‘|STR|’ is the length of a particular string including spaces.

Solution:

string replaceSpaces(string &str)
{
	string temp = "";
    
    for(int i = 0 ; i < str.length() ; i++)
    {
        if(str[i] == ' ')
        {
            temp.push_back('@');
            temp.push_back('4');
            temp.push_back('0');
		}
        
        else
       	{
            temp.push_back(str[i]);
		}
	}
    return temp;
}
