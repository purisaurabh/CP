You are given a three integers 'X', 'N', and 'M'. Your task is to find ('X' ^ 'N') % 'M'. A ^ B is defined as A raised to power B and A % C is the remainder when A is divided by C.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains a single integer 'T', representing the number of test cases. 

The first line of each test contains three space-separated integers 'X', 'N', and 'M'.
Output Format :
For each test case, return a single line containing the value of ('X' ^ 'N') % 'M'.
Note:
You don't need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Follow Up :
Can you solve the problem in O(log 'N') time complexity and O(1) space complexity?
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 100   
1 <= X, N, M <= 10^9

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
2 
3 1 2
4 3 10
Sample Output 1 :
1
4
Explanation For Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, 
X = 3, N = 1, and M = 2 
X ^ N = 3 ^ 1 = 3 
X ^ N % M = 3 % 2 = 1. 
So the answer will be 1.

In test case 2,
X = 4, N = 3, and M = 10 
X ^ N = 4 ^ 3 = 64 
X ^ N % M = 64 % 10 = 4. 
So the answer will be 4.
Sample Input 2 :
2
5 2 10 
2 5 4
Sample Output 2 :
5
0
Explanation For Sample Output 2:
In test case 1, 
X = 5, N = 2, and M = 10 
X^N = 5^2 = 25 
X^N %M = 25 % 10 = 5. 
So the answer will be 5.

In test case 2,
X = 2, N = 5, and M = 4 
X^N = 2^5 = 32 
X^N %M = 32 % 4 = 0. 
So the answer will be 0.





Solution:



int modularExponentiation(int x, int n, int m) {
	//Fast Exponentiation concept used 
    
    int ans = 1;
    
    while(n>0){
        if(n&1){	//odd no. => extra x multiply
            ans = (1LL * ans * (x)%m);	//2^even * x =>	here, otherwise do normal power like a ^ (b/2)^2
        }	//we can also do ans = (1LL * ans * (x)%m)%m => %m at last coz excessive mod Ms will not change result
        //for even no. & odd - one no. upwards multiply
	x = ( 1LL * (x)%m * (x)%m);			// x = x*x;
        //	//we can also do x = ( 1LL * (x)%m * (x)%m)%m => %m at last coz excessive mod Ms will not change result
	n = n>>1; 						// n=n/2;
    }
    return ans;							//typecast by multilying 1LL => 1 long long so in case of 2^9 it does becomes 2^18 so long long can hold
}
